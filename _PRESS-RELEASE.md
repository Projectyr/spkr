There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  SPKR  

## Sub-Heading ##
  Designed for people who need to speak in front of large groups often, SPKR allows presenters to continuously improve on their public speaking skills.

## Summary ##
  SPKR allows presenters to improve on their public speaking abilities by way of crowdsourcing audience feedback. SPKR generates a unique link to a feedback form for a speaker's presentation that they can provide to audience members at the end of a talk. Audience members will be able to access the feedback form and rate the speaker's
  performance on criteria ranging from audience connection to body language. 
  Once logged in, presenters will be able to track their overall rating on a specific criteria for a specific presentation as well as their improvement over multiple presentations. This feedback cycle lets users know what they are good at, what they can improve on, and if any changes in the way they present are accomplishing their goals. 

## Problem ##
  Barring enrollment in a formal public speaking course, public speakers are very rarely able to gauge how they come across to audience members. Public speakers are
  rarely ever told what they are good at or what they can improve on. For instance, if a speaker weren't speaking loudly enough during a given presentation, he or she would never know. Even if offhand comments were made, speakers would not be able to track their progress over time and see if new strategies they were implementing were beneficial. 

## Solution ##
  By using SPKR, users are able to see how they did overall on a specific presentation as well as well as how they did on a specific criteria. Additionally, long-time SPKR speakers are able to see how their skills have improved over time.
