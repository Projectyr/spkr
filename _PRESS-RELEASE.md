## Heading ##
  SPKR  

## Sub-Heading ##
  Designed for people who need to speak in front of large groups often, SPKR allows presenters to continuously improve on their public speaking skills.

## Summary ##
  SPKR allows presenters to improve on their public speaking abilities by way of crowdsourcing audience feedback. SPKR generates a unique link to a feedback form for a speaker's presentation that they can provide to audience members at the end of a talk. Audience members will be able to access the feedback form and rate the speaker's performance on criteria ranging from audience connection to body language. 
  Once logged in, presenters will be able to track their overall rating on a specific criteria for a specific presentation as well as their improvement over multiple presentations. This feedback cycle lets users know what they are good at, what they can improve on, and if any changes in the way they present are accomplishing their goals. 

## Problem ##
  Barring enrollment in a formal public speaking course, public speakers are very rarely able to gauge how they come across to audience members. Public speakers are
  rarely ever told what they are good at or what they can improve on. For instance, if a speaker weren't speaking loudly enough during a given presentation, he or she would never know. Even if offhand comments were made, speakers would not be able to track their progress over time and see if new strategies they were implementing were beneficial. 

## Solution ##
  By using SPKR, users are able to see how they did overall on a specific presentation as well as well as how they did on a specific criteria. Additionally, long-time SPKR speakers are able to see how their skills have improved over time.
